I don't know if schthack was still interested in updating qedit for handling random cmode spawns (dat tables 4 and 5). But if so, feel free to pass along this if he was interested.

Handling of table 4 in Qedit looks correct. Vanilla BB client does not allow mixing of table 2 with tables 4 and 5 for a single floor. This is somewhat patchable for BB I think. 

For table 5, rand05A.cfg should look like this:
#
flt: Param1
flt: Param2
flt: Param3
flt: Param4
flt: Param5
32b: Param6
32b: Config #
16b: child_count
16b: child_count


Where param1-6 are the params from the monster data (what you see in "Edit Data" window).
The child_count field appears to be repeated for some reason. Honestly not sure why, it could be a min and max child count. Haven't tested.

And rand05B.cfg should look like this 
#
8b: Monster Type
8b: Config ID
16b: Ratio


Where the Monster Type  field is an index into this array in the client

So Monster Type == 0 gives you 44h = skin 68. Monster Type 1 gives you skin 67, etc. Yes, this includes EP2 monsters too(E1h is Ill Gill). It does not include EP4 in BB. I think this should be put in a cfg because this is easily patchable to include EP4.

The form for rand05B.cfg in Qedit is displaying fields from rand05A.cfg, and it's also displaying from... somewhere else? Not sure.

I haven't tested yet, but I see no reason why this won't work in EP2 CM, and it's easily patchable to include EP4 CM. Will do a POC next week maybe through hex editing just for a couple rooms in some EP2 area. Done enough PSO dev stuff recently.

The wavesetting field for the EP1 CM map events is 
8b: min enemies
8b: max enemies
8b: max waves
8b: always zero?

For BB, the client has to be patched for any of this random spawn stuff to work in NM. I assume it's the same for V3. Fortunately for BB's case, the patch doesn't seem that complicated.


In case scht wants to debug the BB client for anything related to this,

0x80e008 - start of the main function generating map events and monsters for a floor for dat tables 4 and 5
0x80e930 - start of function to get spawn points for a map event
0x80e774 - start of function to apply a table 5 config to a monster init structure
0x80e884 - start of function to put spawn point data into a monster init structure
0x980760 - table of the weird index -> monster skin for cmode
0xaafe94 to 0xaafec4 - Various globals used by that main function


All virtual addresses
but shouldn't need to look at any of that, I think
